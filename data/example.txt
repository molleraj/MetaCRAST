The included metagenome has the following characteristics:

454 sequencing model - homopolymer errors (Balzer et al., 2010)
Average read length: 600 bp
Standard deviation: 50 bp
Distribution: Normal
Generated with Grinder (Angly et al., 2012)

Taxonomic profile used to generate the metagenome: 
Leptospirillum sp. Group II 'CF-1', complete genome - gi|906338582|ref|NZ_CP012147.1| 65
Ferroplasma acidarmanus fer1, complete genome - gi|518651360|ref|NC_021592.1| 35

This is a way oversimplified representation of an acid mine drainage (AMD) metagenome.
